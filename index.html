        <h1 style="color: black">Cardiff University Chat Bot</h1>
        <h2 style = "color: black"> What does the chatbot do? </h2>
        <br>
        <p class="lead">This chatbot is designed to help University Students with any questions they may ask of their personal tutor. The chatbot can answer questions based on department information, such as who is the module leader for a certain module. The chatbot also offers functionality to book meetings with staff members, as well as the ability to view personalised timetables. The chatbot also offers minimal pastoral support, but if you are experiencing mental health problems, it is suggested you speak to your real personal tutor and utilise the university services. </p>
        <br>
        <h2 style=" color: black">How can I use the chatbot?</h2>
        <br>
        <p class = "lead">In order to use the Cardiff University Chatbot, you need a facebook account. Once you have a facebook account, search "Unitutorbot" and say hello to the page. The bot will walk you through as to how to authenticate yourself as a Cardiff University Student, and once this is complete you will have full access to the bot.</p>
        <br>
        <h2 style=" color: black">What data does the chatbot store about me?</h2>
        <br>
        <p class = "lead">The Cardiff University chatbot does not use any new information that the university didn't already have from you, apart from your facebook profile. For a full list of what data is stored about you, contact the IT service desk.</p>
        <br>
        <h2 style=" color: black">Who is the chatbot designed for?</h2>
        <br>
        <p class = "lead">The Cardiff University chatbot is solely designed for students to use and interact with, and is here to answer any questions students may ask of their personal tutor.</p>
        <br>
